In this project, we are mainly using two major functions of Buddy Robot: Move and Rotate. The main actions are defined in the run() method. In this project, the robot is instructed to move forward 50 cm (0.5m) at a speed of 50 cm/sec (0.5 m/sec). Once the move has been finished, the robot moves backward 25 cm at the same speed but in the opposite direction. When this move is completed, the robot will rotate 180 degrees at a speed of 30 degrees/sec. Upon its completion, it moves forward again for 50 cm at 0.5 m/sec.
